# Getting Started

Welcome to the Nyte.js documentation.

This section provides an overview of how Nyte works and what makes it unique.
You will learn the core ideas behind the framework before moving on to setup or code.

---

## Overview

Nyte is a full-stack framework built with a focus on speed, simplicity, and flexibility.
It allows you to build complete web applications, from frontend components to backend routes, using a single unified structure.

Nyte.js is designed around the following principles:

- Instant development feedback
- Native TypeScript support
- Automatic routing for both frontend and backend
- Seamless and secure integration between frontend and backend, allowing client code to safely call server functions directly
- Built-in performance optimizations

Nyte scales naturally, whether you are building a small project or a large production-ready application.

## What You Should Know

Before working with Nyte, you should be familiar with:

- HTML for markup
- CSS for styling
- TypeScript for application logic
- React for building user interfaces

A basic understanding of React will help you quickly understand the concepts and workflow used by Nyte.js.
